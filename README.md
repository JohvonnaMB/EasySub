<h1>EasySub App</h1>
<p>As University of Waterloo students who are constantly alternating between co-op terms and school terms, we have found ourselves either needing a place to sublet or looking for another student to sublet from us. Term after term, the process of connecting with others in the Waterloo/Kitchener region seemed to be a nuisance for both the subleter and subletee. Creating a simple, easy, and useful solution to this common problem that so many students like ourselves face was the inspiration for EasySub!</p>
<p>EasySub is an Android Application that links individuals looking for a property to sublet with others hoping to sublet their properties. It does so through an intuitive interface that allows any subletter to view available properties in the Kitchener/Waterloo region, read the property details, and contact the sublettees of the properties that interest them. On the other hand, as a sublettee, you can post descriptive details about your property, including pictures, price, and amenities to entice the many subletters browsing on EasySub.</p>
<p>EasySub was programmed in Java using Android Studio. A Google Maps API was implemented to help users view the available properties around them on a map.</p>
